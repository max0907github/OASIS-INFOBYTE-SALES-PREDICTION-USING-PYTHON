# Sales Prediction Using Python

## Overview
This project, completed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte, focuses on predicting future sales based on historical sales data. Leveraging Pythonâ€™s data science libraries, I aimed to create a reliable model to provide actionable insights into sales forecasting.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the data to understand patterns and relationships, providing insight into sales trends.
- **Modeling and Prediction**: Built and evaluated predictive models to estimate future sales accurately.
- **Evaluation and Optimization**: Fine-tuned the models to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the notebook to view the project results.

## Results
The models developed achieved promising accuracy in sales prediction, enabling better decision-making for sales strategies.
